# Mars Rover Kata

## The Kata
Develop an API that moves a rover around a grid on Mars.
- You are given the initial starting point(x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
- The rover receives a string of commands
- Implement commands that:
    - Move the rover forward(f)
    - Move the rover backward(b)
    - Turn the rover left(l)
    - Turn the rover right(r)
- Implement wrapping from one edge or the grid to another ( Planets are spheres after all )

## Hint
Your constructor should look like: MarsRover(location, direction, grid).
E.g var rover = new MarsRover([0,0],’e’,[50,50]);

## Example
The rover is on a 100x100 grid at location (0, 0) and facing SOUTH. The rover is given the commands "fflff" and
should end up at (2,2).

## Bonus
Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an
obstacle the rover moves up to the last possible point and reports the obstacle. You will need to amend your code to

- 03-08-2019: First Implementation. All commands should be works but the position still have no validation.
